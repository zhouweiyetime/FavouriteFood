Heat the oil over a high flame in a                     heavy-based frying pan that will comfortably fit both steaks. When the oil is shimmering, turn the heat down to medium-high and add the                    butter. Once it’s sizzling, carefully lay the steaks in the pan, tucking the garlic and herbs in at the sides." +
                  "\n2. Stand over the steaks with a pair of tongs, searing and turning them every 30 seconds to 1 min so they get a nice brown crust. As a rough guide, each steak will take 4 mins in total for rare, 5-6 mins in total for medium and 8-10 mins for well done. If you have a digital cooking thermometer, the temperatures you're looking for in middle of the steak are 50C for rare, 60C for medium and 70C for well done. Leave the steaks to rest for at least 5 mins. While the steaks are resting, you can make a classic red wine sauce to go with them."
